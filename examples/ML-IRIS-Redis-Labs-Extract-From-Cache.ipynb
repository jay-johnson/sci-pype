    "This notebook demonstrates how to extract the machine learning Models + Analysis from the Online Redis Enterprise Cloud (https://redislabs.com/redis-cloud) cache named **CACHE**\" and saved locally as a compressed, string artifact file (Pickle + zlib compression). Once the file is saved, it is uploaded to the configured S3 Bucket for archiving and sharing.\n",

After extraction, compile a manifest for defining a cache mapping for all the Models + their respective Analysis. Once cached, the Models can be extract and shared + deployed on other Sci-pype instances by using something like this notebook or the command-line versions.\n",
